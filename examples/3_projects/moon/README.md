*_mesh_* notebooks are using triangular mesh - fast, but eats up lots of memory.

*_displacement_* notebooks are displacing a sphere surface - slower, but can make much more detailed Moon.

Use *_remote.ipynb notebooks on remote servers, raytracing output is inlined between cells there.

The tutorial text is coming!
